Click the Letters to Change color to code for confidence:
I use 
- Red for low confidence.
- Yellow for confident.
- Green for confirmed.
- Clear is default.

Will highlight in the output to show confidence. :D

It will use the Crypto letters if nothing is filled; I like to use ? or _ to help visualize what I need to add.

Updated the toggle with a "_" to help better visualize without noise. Also added a counter to show how many characters words have.
